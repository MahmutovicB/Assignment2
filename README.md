This repository is made for the Assignment 2 from the course Foundations of Web Development. 
First commit in this repo is actually Assignment 1, which i used as a starting point for this Assignment.
Every task was commited one by one as the process was going on. 
You can find all commits, track their development, changes and features who I added. 

I used the Live Server to start up the web site, so I recommend using Live Server. 
You can try any other way, it should probably work. 
index.html is a starting page, from there you can navigate through the web-site and back, 
explore all the features and enjoy the UI that I have created for you.
